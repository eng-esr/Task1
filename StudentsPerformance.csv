Data Analysis Questions for Student Performance Dataset

1. Pass/Fail Classification:


"How many students passed all subjects (math, reading, and writing), assuming a passing score is 50 or above in each subject?"

2. Subject-wise Pass Count:


How many students passed only math? How many passed only reading? How many passed only writing?

3. Gender-wise Performance:


How many male and female students passed all subjects? Provide a breakdown by gender.

4. Highest Scoring Student:


"Identify the student(s) with the highest total score across math, reading, and writing. What is the total score?"

5. Average Scores by Gender:


"What is the average score for math, reading, and writing for male and female students? Which gender performs better on average in each subject?"

6. Performance by Parental Education:


"Calculate the number of students who passed all subjects, grouped by their parental level of education. What is the trend?"

7. Top 10% Students:


"Identify the top 10% of students based on their total score (math + reading + writing). How many students are in this group, and what is the score cutoff?"

8. Failing Students:


"How many students failed at least one subject (scoring below 50 in math, reading, or writing)? Provide a count of these students."

9. Correlation Between Scores:


"Is there a strong correlation between math, reading, and writing scores? Which two subjects show the strongest relationship, and how could this insight help in educational strategies?"

10. Grade Distribution:


"Classify the students into three categories: ""High Performers"" (total score >= 240), ""Average Performers"" (total score between 150 and 239), and ""Low Performers"" (total score < 150). How many students fall into each category?"
